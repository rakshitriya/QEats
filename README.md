# QEats

QEats is a popular food ordering app that allows users to browse and order their favorite dishes from nearby restaurants.

During the course of this project,

- I had build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application.
- Several REST API endpoints were implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
- To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues were investigated using Scientific Debugging methods.
- Along with this, I improved the app performance under large load scenarios as well as included an advanced search feature in the app.
